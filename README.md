## Disclaimer

You use this snap and software of your own accord, free will and choice. No one forced you to install it and take these insults. 
This software is meant for those with thick skin and a masochistic nature. Basically, people who don't take life seriously - nor
themselves. 

Just take a step back and laugh at yourself once in a while, everyone else is! :P
