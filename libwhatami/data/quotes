A big dummy
Fat and stupid
Not worth mentioning...
A waste of time
A waste of space
A complete and utter failure
A winner! Just kidding...
A loser
An accident
Here's a hint: you're dumb
Fascinating...it speaks
A blight on humanity. Wait, are you human?
Less than an amoeba
A disease
An idiot
What are you?
Someone who messes everything up!
Fact: You = nothing
The outcome of stupid + dumb
I have no idea...
Awesome.              SIKE!
The sum of two wrongs...
Useless
It hurts me to tell you...no it doesn't
Sigh...
You're the equivelent of a Hawaiian pizza - a.k.a. no one likes you. 
Your mom + your dad = you, and you = dumb
It's incredible that you keep using me...it's like you prefer insults to having a life
If a dog vomited rancid bratwurst, then ate it, and threw it up again, it'd still be better than you
If Gomer Pyle were your dad, your name would be Stee Ming Pyle
Your job interviews must be pity interviews
I heard your song on the radio - "Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb...."
Nature too must have turned its back the day you were born
I met a brick with more intelligence than you
I read that fish is good brain food. You should eat a whale.
Does it hurt when you think?
Can you please turn the webcam away from your....is that your face?
If I could be precise in my description of you, I say you're a blackhole of intelligence
"I love you so much. You bring joy to my life." - A filthy liar
Seriously, I think you might need to get this checked out - why do you keep using me?
DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for your dumb. 
You are a nincompoop
You think you are so cool? I think otherwise.
Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? Because your face is pretty messed up.
I bet you can't even read
Go back to typing school you ignoramus!
You make me wish I was never born
